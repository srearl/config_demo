## config_demo

what you do not see in the repository because I am instructing Git to ignore it, is the file `config.yml`, which has the following contents:

`
default:
  path: ~/Dropbox/floating/my_awesome_lab/
`

Each lab member would have a `config.yml` file in their local repository with the path to where the lab folder is mapped to their machine. They also would include `config.yml` in their `.gitignore` file.
